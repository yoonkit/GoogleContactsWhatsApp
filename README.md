# Google Contacts with WhatsApp links

## Creates WhatsApp links within Google Contact Phone numbers using Tampermonkey

* Adds in a WhatsApp icon for each telephone number in Google Contacts.
* Assumed that all numbers can be WhatsApp'ed.
* Currently doesnt check if the number is registered to WhatsApp.

## Currently Works

* Displays the icon in the giant listing page, if the "Phone Number" column is enabled.
* In the Person's "Contact Details" is shown, all phone types will be linked to a WhatsApp icon.

## Note

* Please make sure that when you enter in the Phone Numbers, the country codes are correct.
* Hopefully Google doesnt update the Class Names of the fields anytime soon.
